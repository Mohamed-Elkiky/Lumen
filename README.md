# Lumen

**A physically based path tracer written from scratch in modern C++.**

No game engine, no graphics API. Every pixel is computed by simulating how light bounces around a scene.

*Cornell box, 600x600, 500 samples per pixel. Note the red/green colour bleeding on the white surfaces and the caustic under the glass sphere.*

## Features

- **Monte Carlo path tracing** with recursive bounces and Russian-roulette-free depth limiting
- **Materials**
  - Lambertian (matte)
  - Metal with adjustable roughness (fuzz)
  - Dielectric (glass, water, diamond) with Snell's law, total internal reflection and Schlick's approximation
  - Emissive area lights
- **Geometry**
  - Spheres and quads (parallelograms)
  - Triangles with Möller-Trumbore intersection
  - Wavefront `.obj` mesh loading with scale, rotate and translate on load
  - Smooth shading from vertex normals, generated automatically for models that don't include them
- **BVH acceleration** with binned Surface Area Heuristic (SAH) splits: 2,168x faster on the Stanford bunny, pixel-identical output
- **Positionable camera** with configurable field of view, look-at and up vector
- **Antialiasing** via jittered supersampling
- **Gamma correction** and PNG output
- **Deterministic renders** from a fixed random seed, so output can be diffed byte for byte
- **Unit tests** with CTest

## Progress

Lumen is being built in public, one sprint at a time. Each render below was a milestone.

## Performance

| Scene | Resolution | Samples | Threads | Acceleration | Time |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cornell box | 600x600 | 500 | 1 | None | 135.4 s |
| Sir Hops-a-Lot, the Stanford bunny (69k tris) | 400x400 | 16 | 1 | None | 3702.9 s |
| Sir Hops-a-Lot, the Stanford bunny (69k tris) | 400x400 | 16 | 1 | BVH (midpoint) | 2.5 s |
| Sir Hops-a-Lot, the Stanford bunny (69k tris) | 400x400 | 16 | 1 | BVH (SAH) | **1.7 s** |
| XYZ RGB dragon (250k tris) | 400x400 | 16 | 1 | BVH (SAH) | 2.2 s |

Without acceleration, every ray is tested against every triangle, so render time grows linearly with mesh size. The BVH takes the bunny from an hour to under 2 seconds: a **2,168x speedup**. The dragon has 3.6x more triangles than the bunny but takes only 1.3x as long, which is logarithmic scaling in action. SAH splits beat a simple median split by 1.45x.

Output is unchanged: renders use a fixed random seed, so the bunny PNG is byte-for-byte identical with and without the BVH, on both Windows (MSVC) and Linux (GCC). Next up: multithreading. Full results are in [docs/benchmarks.md](docs/benchmarks.md).

## Build and run

Requires CMake 3.20+ and a C++17 compiler (MSVC, GCC or Clang).

**Linux / macOS**
```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
./build/lumen
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**
```powershell
cmake -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
.\build\Release\lumen.exe
```

The render is written to `output.png`. Run `lumen` from the repo root so it can find `assets/`. To change scenes, edit the scene picker in `main()` in `src/main.cpp`.

Options:

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--no-bvh` | Test every object per ray (brute force, for benchmarking) |
| `--midpoint` | Build the BVH with median splits instead of SAH |
| `--out FILE` | Write the render to `FILE` instead of `output.png` |

Run the tests with:
```bash
ctest --test-dir build -C Release
```

### Models

Mesh models are large, so they're not committed. Download them into `assets/models/`:

```bash
mkdir -p assets/models
curl -L -o assets/models/teapot.obj https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alecjacobson/common-3d-test-models/master/data/teapot.obj
curl -L -o assets/models/stanford-bunny.obj https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alecjacobson/common-3d-test-models/master/data/stanford-bunny.obj
curl -L -o assets/models/xyzrgb_dragon.obj https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alecjacobson/common-3d-test-models/master/data/xyzrgb_dragon.obj
```

On Windows PowerShell, use `curl.exe` instead of `curl`.

| File | Triangles | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `teapot.obj` | ~6.3k | Correctness check |
| `stanford-bunny.obj` | ~69k | Benchmark scene (Sir Hops-a-Lot) |
| `xyzrgb_dragon.obj` | ~250k | Stress test |

The full 870k-triangle Stanford dragon is available as PLY from the [Stanford 3D Scanning Repository](https://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/).

## How it works

1. The **camera** fires rays through each pixel, many per pixel with random jitter (antialiasing).
2. Each ray walks a **bounding volume hierarchy** (a tree of boxes) to find the **closest hit**. Any box the ray misses is skipped along with everything inside it, so only a handful of the scene's triangles are ever tested.
3. The hit surface's **material** decides what happens next: scatter randomly (matte), reflect (metal), refract or reflect (glass), or emit light (lights).
4. The ray **bounces** recursively, picking up colour from each surface, until it escapes the scene or hits the bounce limit.
5. All samples for a pixel are **averaged**, gamma corrected and written to PNG.

Because light paths are simulated physically, effects like soft shadows, colour bleeding and caustics appear naturally, without being programmed in.

Meshes are loaded as lists of triangles. Where a model has vertex normals, the normal at each hit point is blended from the triangle's three corners using barycentric coordinates. This makes a faceted mesh render as a smooth surface.

### The BVH

Every object knows its **axis-aligned bounding box**. The BVH groups objects into a binary tree of boxes, and a ray tests a box with the **slab method** before looking inside it.

- **Build:** at each node, Lumen tries 15 candidate split planes per axis (16 bins) and picks the one with the lowest **Surface Area Heuristic** cost: `area(left) x count(left) + area(right) x count(right)`. A ray is likelier to hit a bigger box, so SAH keeps big boxes nearly empty. Leaves hold up to 4 primitives.
- **Traversal:** the ray visits the nearer child first. Once it hits something there, the far child is only searched up to that distance, so most of the far side's boxes are rejected straight away.
